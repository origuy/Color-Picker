## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Designed in figma

### What I learned

the project was very insightful for me i've learned:

- How to design an app from 0 to 100
- Design the UI and UX of the app
- Word with modern HTML syntax
- How to work with localStorage
- How to toggle attributes and work with classList

```html
<dialog class="dialog">
	<p class="dialogParagraph"></p>
</dialog>
}
```

```JavaScript
dialogGrabber.addEventListener('click',(evt) => {

    for(let i = 0; i < Object.entries(localStorage).length; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < Object.entries(localStorage)[i].length; j++){
            if(Object.entries(localStorage)[i][1] === evt.path[0].innerText){
               colorPicker =  Object.entries(localStorage)[i][0];
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(colorPicker)
})
```

```JavaScript
        heart.classList.toggle('visible')

```

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on:

- more organized code and clean code.
- deeper understanding of front end subjects like SCSS and JavaScript.
